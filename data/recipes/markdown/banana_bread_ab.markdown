Wet Works 1
3-4 overripe bananas
1 cup sugar

Wet Works 2
1 stick butter, melted & cooled
2 eggs
1 tsp almond extract

The Dry Goods
1 2/3 cup flour
1/3 cup oat flour (Measure 1/3 cup oatmeal and blend it to a coarse consistency in a processor)
1 tsp baking soda
1 tsp salt

Optional
1 cup chopped nuts

Steps:

Preheat oven to 350ยบ.

Place bananas & sugar in large mixing bowl and mash them together with a potato masher until smooth. 
Combine wet works 1 and wet works 2 in separate bowls, then combine together before adding the wet works to the dry goods.

Fold in the nuts, if using, then pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and bake for 50 min to 1 hour, until temperature measures 210F, or a toothpick inserted in the center comes out more or less clean, but banana bread should come out of the oven a little moister than most.

Allow bread to cool in the pan for 15 min, then remove it from the pan and place on a rack to cool completely before slicing.

Tightly wrapped, this bread will keep at room temp for 5 days.
