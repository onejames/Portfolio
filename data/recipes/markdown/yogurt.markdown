1/2 galloon of milk
3 Tbsp starter
3/4 - 1 Cup dry milk (impacts thickness)
2 Tbsp sugar
pinch salt

Note:
	you can all flavorings… 

RESPECT CONTAMINATION

Heat milk to 185° the longer the milk stays at this temp the thicker the yogurt. Don't go over 30min.

Cool the milk in a sink of cool water until 110°. Add all other ingredients. Warm the starter to ease the transition.

Jar the yogurt. Maintain 100° for 8-12 hours. The longer incubation the more tangy the yogurt.
