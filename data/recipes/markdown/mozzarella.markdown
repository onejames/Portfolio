Equipment:
1. 8 quart pot either enameled or stainless steel.
2. Thermometer.
//3. A couple measuring cups or something to dissolve the Citric Acid and Rennet in.
4. big strainer.
5. long sharp knife.
6. slotted spoon.
7. Large bowl.
8. Small bowl.
//9. Microwave.

Optional:
10. Cheese cloth.
11. Small strainer.

Ingredients:
1. 1 gallon Milk, about 50 degrees. (2% or skimmed milk.)
2. 1 Rennet tablet crushed
3. 2 teaspoons Citric Acid divided.
4. 1/2 cup declorinated water divided in 2. 
5. 1 teaspoon salt.

Directions:
1. Pour 1 teaspoon Citric Acid into 1/4 cup unchlorinated water and stir. Crush the Rennet tablet and pour it into the other cup of unchlorinated water.  
2. If you haven't done so already, pour milk into your pot. Make sure the milk is around 50 degrees when you pour in the Citric Acid 
3. Pour the dissolved Citric Acid in the milk and stir for 1 minute. 
4. Sprinkle the other teaspoon of Citric Acid in the milk and sir for another minute. The milk will start to curdle shortly.
5. Heat the milk to 88-90 degrees.
6. Turn off the heat and stir in the Rennet solution for 15-20 seconds.
7. After 20-30 min When you poke your finger into it and move for an inch or so and lift it out, the Curd and Whey should separate shortly. If it is still liquidy (Is that a real word?) and sticks to your finger let it set a while longer.
8. Cut the Curds into 1/2 inch cubes.
9. let set for 5-10 min.
10. Apply low heat and stir the curds occasionally to keep them separated until they reach 108 degrees. This will take about 15 minutes. The Curds will shrink and start to sink as the Whey is expelled from them.
11. Turn off the heat and continue stirring every few minutes for an additional 20 minutes. The Curds will keep shrinking.
12. Drain the Curds into a strainer or colander and let set for about 15 minutes. Let the Curds drain until no more Whey comes out of them. You can either dump the Whey or save it to make Ricotta.
13. Boil a pot of salted water, place the curds into a fresh bowl, and pour the boiling water over. Let the curds sit for a few minutes.
14. Stretch into a ball.
15. Taste for saltiness and adjust accordingly.
