##Ingredients
* 2 cups All-purpose Flour
* 1/2 cup Sugar
* 3 Tablespoons Sugar
* 2-1/4 teaspoons Baking Powder
* 1-1/4 teaspoon Salt
* 2 teaspoons Ground Cinnamon
* 2 whole Large Eggs
* 3/4 cups Whole Milk
* 2 teaspoons Vanilla Extract
* 2 Tablespoons Melted Butter
* 2 whole Granny Smith Apples, Peeled And Diced
* Powdered Sugar (optional, For Dusting)

##Glaze (optional)
* 1-1/2 cup Powdered Sugar
* 1/4 teaspoon Salt
* 1/4 teaspoon Vanilla
* 1/4 cup Milk

##Directions
In a mixing bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt.
In a separate bowl, beat the eggs with a fork, then add milk, melted butter, and vanilla.
Gently fold dry and wet ingredients together until just combined (do not overmix.) Fold in apples. Add enough apples to make a very chunky batter. You want the apples to shine though!

Heat a couple of inches of canola oil over medium to medium-low heat. When it gets hot, drop a little drop of batter into the oil. If it sizzles immediately and rises to the top, the oil is ready; if it burns quickly, turn down the heat.

Drop teaspoons of batter into the hot oil, six or eight at a time. Sometimes they'll flip over by themselves; sometimes you have to flip them. Just watch them and make sure they don't get too brown, but cook them long enough to make sure the batter's cooked through, 
about 2 to 2 1/2 minutes total.

Remove and drain on a paper towel. Dust very generously with powdered sugar, or dip fritters in a light doughnut glaze (mix all glaze ingredients together, then dunk warm fritters).
Serve warm!
