Ingredients
1 8-ounce package udon noodles
4 tablespoons roasted peanut oil, or 3 tablespoons sesame oil mixed with 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 12-ounce package firm tofu, cut into 12 pieces
Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper
1 11-ounce package Asian cooking greens or baby spinach
1 bunch scallions, thinly sliced diagonally
Large pinch of red pepper flakes
3 tablespoons soy sauce
Pinch of sugar
Directions
Cook the udon noodles as the label directs. (Don't overcook or they will get mushy.) Drain, reserving about 1/3 cup of the cooking water.

Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Pat the tofu dry and season all over with salt and pepper. Add the tofu to the skillet and sear until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. Set aside and keep warm.

Add 1 tablespoon oil and the greens to the skillet. Cook, tossing, until just wilted. Add the scallions, red pepper flakes, the remaining 1 tablespoon oil, the soy sauce and sugar. Add the reserved cooking water; heat to create a broth. Divide the noodles and greens among 4 bowls and top with the tofu.
