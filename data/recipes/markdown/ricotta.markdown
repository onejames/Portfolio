Equipment:
2. Large bowl
3. Reusable coffee filter. You can also use a clean cloth.
4. Large Strainer that you used for the Mozzarella
5. Small bowl to put the final product in

Ingredients:
1. Leftover whey (from 1 gal milk)

Directions:
1. Pour the Whey into your pot and heat back up to 200 - 220 degrees. The temperature here is not critical and you don't have to do it slow. 
2. Turn the heat off and let it cool down some. If there is stuff floating on top stir it so that it sinks to the bottom.
3. Filter the whey, and let drain.
4. The solids that collect in the filter is ricotta.
