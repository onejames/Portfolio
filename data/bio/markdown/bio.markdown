#About Me...

James Laster, born in January of 1982. 

My Mother retired as a School Psycologist. My Father majored in librial arts, and lead a R&D team for Cook Urilogical. Unfortinatly I did not inharret my fathers/grandfathers inine artistic skill.

I am a self-labeled autodiadect, and can teach myself just about anything. Which is why my [projects](/projects) section is a small sample of my hobbies over the years.
